A website for every Nomad!

Built on MEN stack (mongo-express-node)

For front end used Bootstrap4 library, google fonts, font awesome


Contains authorization, authentication, google maps API, cloud API for storing image,
full CRUD functionality with campgrounds(was thinking about a lot how to call it), comments,
routes according to RESTful principles, landing page ("/"), forgotten password feature(token active for 1h)...

I will constantly be adding to this projects things like paginator, user routes, links from Campground-Show route etc.



Please feel free to use as you wish.
