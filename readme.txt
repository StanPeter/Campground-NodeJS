A website for every Nomad!

Built on MEN stack (mongo-express-node)

For front end used Bootstrap4 library, google fonts, font awesome


Contains authorization, authentication, google maps API, cloud API for storing image,
full CRUD functionality with campgrounds(was thinking about a lot how to call it), comments,
routes according to RESTful principles, landing page ("/"), forgotten password feature(token active for 1h)...

I will constantly be adding to this projects things like paginator, user routes, links from Campground-Show route etc.



Please feel free to use as you wish.


things to improve
"""
some space needed to the description show route, would be nice paginator and buttons on index route hover color change.

Price is per night not per trip, a quick change later on

comments too close to each other
